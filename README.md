HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a complete HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to help organizations analyze workforce trends, monitor attrition, and support data-driven HR decisions. The dashboard transforms raw HR data into clear insights on employee demographics, salary structure, attrition behavior, and job role distribution.
